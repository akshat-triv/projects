    <h1>The meaning of colors in web design</h1> 
    <h2>Picking a color for a website means more then picking your favorite color and turning it into a design. It means picking the right color in order to get the desired response from your audience. Color really makes a difference. This happens because there are psychological effects behind each color.</h2>
